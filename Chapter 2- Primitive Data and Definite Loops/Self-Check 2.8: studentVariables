Imagine you are writing a program that stores a student's year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior), the number of 
courses the student is taking, and his or her GPA on a 4.0 scale. Declare variables with the appropriate names and types to 
hold this information. Write a complete variable declaration statement with the type, the variable name, and a semicolon.

year	        -------> String year;
courses taken	-------> int courses;
GPA	          -------> double gpa;
