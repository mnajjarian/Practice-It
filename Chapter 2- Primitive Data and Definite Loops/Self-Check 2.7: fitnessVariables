Imagine you are writing a personal fitness program that stores the user's age, gender, height (in feet or meters), and 
weight (to the nearest pound or kilogram). Declare variables with the appropriate names and types to hold this information. 
Write a complete variable declaration statement with the type, the variable name, and a semicolon.

age	    -------> int age;
gender	-------> String gender;
height	-------> double height;
weight	-------> int weight;
