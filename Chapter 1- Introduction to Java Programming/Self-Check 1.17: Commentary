What is the output of the following program? Note that the program contains several comments.


public class Commentary {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("some lines of code");
        System.out.println("have // characters on them");
        System.out.println("which means ");  // that they are comments
        // System.out.println("written by the programmer.");
​
        System.out.println("lines can also");
        System.out.println("have /* and */ characters");
        /* System.out.println("which represents");
        System.out.println("a multi-line style");
        */ System.out.println("of comment.");
    }
}
